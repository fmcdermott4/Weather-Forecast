# Weather-Forecast

##Description

Do you want to quickly plan a vacation around the weather? If so, this Weather Forecaster can quickly show you the current weather and the next five days projected weather of your chosen city. This app automatically saves your searches so that you can easily compare city weathers. Notice that depending on the intensity of ultra violent radiation, the intensity of the red background is either deep or more opaque. Do enter a real location or you will get an error message!
